        <p>This is Yuzhe Hao, from Yangquan, a small city in Shanxi, where I built the base rock of my personality with a bunch of very nice guys. Now I lived in Futako-tamakawa, a beautiful area around river in Tokyo, fancy like a dew in the morning's leaf.</p>
        <p>I am suffering from severe procrastination and lack of self-conrtrol, which means I have to fight with my auto-polit and defense lawyer literally every moment. They are parts of me and helped a lot to escape from bad feelings. But I have to take the control back for achieving my career's aim.

        <p>Being better is not a easy thing and usally takes long long time.</p>
        <p>Just go experiencing it, and have a good time with it.</p>
